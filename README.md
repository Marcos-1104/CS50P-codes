# My CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python Projects #

Welcome to my repository for Harvard's CS50P course! This repository contains all of my solutions for the problem sets and my final project, completed as part of my journey to learn Python. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific problem set from the course, demonstrating the concepts and skills I learned each week.

## About This Course ##

CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python is a comprehensive course that teaches the fundamentals of programming using Python. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax, variables, and loops to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, file I/O, regular expressions, and unit testing with pytest. This collection of projects represents my progress and understanding of these core concepts.

## Projects Overview ##

Here is a list of the problem sets and the final project included in this repository. Each folder contains the Python files with my solutions.

* Problem Set 0: Functions, Variables
  - Indoor Voice, Playback Speed, Making Faces, Einstein, Tip Calculator

Focus: Basic Python syntax, functions, and working with strings and numbers.

* Problem Set 1: Conditionals
  - Deep Thought, Home Federal Savings Bank, File Extensions, Math Interpreter, Meal Time

Focus: Implementing logic with if, elif, and else statements.

* Problem Set 2: Loops
  - Camel Case, Coke Machine, Just setting up my twttr, Vanity Plates, Nutrition Facts

Focus: Using for and while loops to solve problems and iterate over data.

* Problem Set 3: Exceptions
  - Fuel Gauge, Felipe's Taqueria, Grocery List, Outdated

Focus: Handling errors gracefully with try...except blocks.

* Problem Set 4: Libraries
  - Emojize, Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters, Adieu, Adieu, Guessing Game, Little Professor, Bitcoin Price Index

Focus: Using third-party libraries like requests and emoji, and creating modules.

* Problem Set 5: Unit Tests
  - Testing my twttr, Back to the Bank, Re-requesting a Vanity Plate, Refueling

Focus: Writing unit tests with pytest to verify the correctness of functions.

* Problem Set 6: File I/O
  - Lines of Code, Pizza Py, Scourgify, CS50 P-Shirt

Focus: Reading from and writing to files, including text files and CSVs.

* Problem Set 7: Regular Expressions
  - NUMB3RS, Watch on YouTube, Working 9 to 5, Regular, um, Expressions, Response Validation

Focus: Using regex to validate and extract information from strings.

* Problem Set 8: Object-Oriented Programming
  - Seasons of Love, Cookie Jar, CS50 Shirtificate

Focus: Designing and implementing custom classes with methods, properties, and class methods.

## Final Project: Python Command-Line Cafe ##

My final project is a complete, interactive command-line restaurant ordering system. This project brings together all the concepts learned throughout the course, including functions, loops, exception handling, file I/O, and object-oriented programming with a custom Order class.

## Key Features: ##

* Interactive Menu: Displays a menu with items, prices, and emojis.
* Order Management: Users can add multiple items to their order. The program keeps track of the quantities of each item.
* Input Validation: The program validates user input to ensure only valid menu items are accepted.
* Clean UI: The terminal screen is cleared after each input to provide a clean and user-friendly experience.
* Final Bill Calculation: Automatically calculates the total cost of the order.
* Receipt Generation: Gives the user the option to save a formatted receipt to a receipt.txt file.

This project was a great opportunity to apply my skills to build a complete application from scratch.
